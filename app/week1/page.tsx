            <p className="text-[#e0e0e0] leading-relaxed text-lg">
              A stress ball robot could be a biofeedback gadget that squeezes itself whenever your heart rate spikes. I‚Äôm thinking that a heart rate sensor would feed data to a microcontroller, which triggers motors or actuators to compress the ball. LEDs could glow red when you‚Äôre stressed and blue when calm, making it both visual and tactile.

            <p className="text-[#e0e0e0] leading-relaxed text-lg">
              I would also want to explore a final project that is more of a ‚Äúdecoration piece‚Äù or a technical-looking kinetic sculpture. Perhaps I could make laser-cut flowers that open and close to ambient music (and on beat). An audio sensor or input from a microcontroller could maybe map sound frequencies and rhythms to the flowers‚Äô blooming motions, creating a living visualizer.

            <p className="text-[#e0e0e0] leading-relaxed text-lg">
              Finally, I was thinking of creating a candy dispenser that is sound-activated and rewards you with a sweet treat when you clap twice. A microphone and simple sound detection circuit could listen for the distinct double-clap pattern, to then trigger a servo motor to open a chute and release a piece of candy.

              Also, I play piano for a few hours a day, mostly improvising with chords, so I‚Äôve also been wondering if I could build a machine that displays chords as I play them ‚Äî either visually on a screen or through a fun physical output (though I have no developed idea for this yet!)
Regardless, my bottom line is I definitely want to make something interactive, endearing, and fun to share with friends (or even bring to a dinner party).
